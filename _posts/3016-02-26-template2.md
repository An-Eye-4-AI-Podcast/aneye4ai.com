You can use the following includes in the body of your posts as shortcuts
for blocks of code that you might otherwise use repetitively. These are
also helpful if you (or I) decide to change the method that the content is
presented; you'd need only change the include file.

## Media embeds

For each of these embeds, the media-id is readily available from the Video's
URL, from the address bar or the share link provided by most shareable media.

For example, the first Vimeo example uses the `id` 66140585
from the video's URL: `https://player.vimeo.com/video/66140585`.

### Vimeo

{% highlight markdown %}
{% raw %}{% include post_vimeo.html id="<media-id>" %}{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

{% include post_vimeo.html id="66140585" %}

### YouTube

{% highlight markdown %}
{% raw %}{% include post_youtube.html id="<media-id>" %}{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

{% include post_youtube.html id="QILiHiTD3uc" %}
